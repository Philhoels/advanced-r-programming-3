This is the 3rd assignment of the course Advanced Programming in R at Link√∂ping University.

## Tasks

1. Write the R Code
- In the first task we had to write a function which uses the eucledian algorithm to find the common divisor of two numbers.
- The second function to be created is the dijkstra algorithm. It is supposed to calculate the distance from an initial node to every other node.
